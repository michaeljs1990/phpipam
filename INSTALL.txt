## Docker

If you would like to run PHPIPAM inside of docker you must fist setup a mysql database. After you
have finished setting one up you can run the following two commands to build your docker image and
then pass it the following variabled according to your setup.

```
$ docker build -t phpipam .
$ docker run -p 8888:80 -e IPAM_HOST='192.168.1.5' -e IPAM_PASS='password' -e IPAM_USER='root' phpipam
```

If you are running your DB inside of docker you will need to log in and run the following command since
access is only setup for localhost via the install script.

```
GRANT ALL on `database`.* to user@'%' identified by 'password';
```

For whatever reason the password also is never set properly so running the following script should fix
everything up for you.

```
php functions/scripts/reset-admin-password.php
```
